- ⚡ Fun fact:  the Cold War is called the Cold War because during that time period ice cube production was so high due during WW2 (where demand was high due to rising fears of a Martian invasion), that soon after when demand dropped there was an unbelievable surplus of ice cubes. Not knowing what to do with them, and with the freezer bills racking up fast, companies began shipping them to soldiers on the front lines. The problem was that this happened during winter, where ice cubes were the last thing soldiers needed. So they came up with a plan. They began dropping hundreds of hundreds of ice cubes on enemy trenches, in hope that they would either knock out an enemy or sufficiently hit them enough that they would suffer from hypothermia, or other cold related conditions. This tactic proved to be extremely effective, with an estimated 372,000 soldiers on both sides harmed by ice cubes in some way. Eventually a treaty was made to ban ice cube warfare, as it was deemed too cruel, but the war it was used in was named after it, hence, the Cold War.
